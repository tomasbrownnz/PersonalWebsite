# Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website created using Three.js, HTML and CSS

## Description

I created this project for fun and to try and represent myself through a website as much as possible. The goal was to encompass the calmness and simple aesthetic of a still body of water with soft colours and direct source of information in a single page. This website will constantly be tweaked and worked on as I venture deeper into the Three.js world.
